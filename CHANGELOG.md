## v0.0.1-alpha11 (2021-03-10)

### Features

- Expose driver type information from the agent [#239](https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/pull/239)

Exposing the types allows developers to import the driver type information
directly from the synthetics package instead of using via playwright specific
packages which would result in inconsistent types (version mismatch or
browser specific types).
